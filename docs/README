-- File Trader --

The following base components are required. See REQUIREMENTS for a list of 
external PHP and JavaScript libraries required for FileTrader.

- PHP 5.3.x
- CouchDB
- PHP With PEAR (HTTP_Download 1.1.4)
- 64 bit system for >2G file uploads

--- Configure ---
Copy config.php.defaults to config.php and modify if needed.

Make sure the database exists in CouchDB. It doesn't need to contain
any documents though. See the script in the docs/ directory to populate 
CouchDB with some entries. You can also use the web based CouchDB 
interface at "http://localhost:<PORT>/_utils".

Create directories and set file permissions:

	# create directories
	mkdir -p data
	mkdir -p data/files
	mkdir -p tpl_c

	# set unix permissions
	chmod o+w -R data tpl_c


--- SELinux Configuration ---

Set the correct SELinux labels (only for Fedora/Red Hat systems?)

	chcon -R -t httpd_sys_rw_content_t data tpl_c

Allow HTTP to access the network (to contact CouchDB) and send mail (for the 
invites)

	sudo setsebool httpd_can_network_connect on
	sudo setsebool httpd_can_sendmail on
