Things still to do:

== 1.0 ==
Big Tasks:
- implement 2-legged OAuth
- implement OpenSocial auth, allow iGoogle access
- custom css/js for plupload instead of default one
- implement automatic class loader
  - add library.config.php file or something to point to (external) PHP/JS 
    libraries

Small Tasks:
- do something better with file name filter on upload, too restrictive now
- figure out how to take care of Pear Download library in a nice way (now 
  as root pear install of the module, ieeuw, and doesn't work with STRICT mode)
- add better logging

== 2.0 ==
- separate "FileTrader" from the actual file uploading/downloading processes
- don't assume we run on Unix-like systems
- add SAML SP module support
- split out group/team stuff to separate classes?
- implement 3-legged OAuth
- implement something like "file collections" to keep files "together"?
- implement tagging / file collections?
