-- File Trader --
The following base components are required. See REQUIREMENTS for a list of 
external PHP and JavaScript libraries required for FileTrader.

- PHP 5.3.x
- CouchDB
- PHP With PEAR	(see below)
	HTTP_Download 1.1.4
- 64 bit system for >2G file uploads

--- Configure ---
Copy config.php.defaults to config.php and modify if needed.

Make sure the database exists in CouchDB. It doesn't need to contain
any documents though. You can use the web based CouchDB 
interface at "http://localhost:<PORT>/_utils" or use CURL:

$ curl -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:5984/filetrader

See the script in the docs/ directory to populate CouchDB with some entries.

Create directories and set file permissions:

# create directories
$ mkdir -p data
$ mkdir -p data/files
$ mkdir -p tpl_c

# set unix permissions
$ chmod o+w -R data tpl_c


--- SELinux Configuration ---
Set the correct SELinux labels (only for Fedora/Red Hat systems?)

$ chcon -R -t httpd_sys_rw_content_t data tpl_c

Allow HTTP to access the network (to contact CouchDB) and send mail (for the 
invites)

$ su -c 'setsebool httpd_can_network_connect on'
$ su -c 'setsebool httpd_can_sendmail on'

--- Setup PEAR ---
See http://pear.php.net/manual/en/installation.shared.php

(You need SSH access to do this)

$ pear config-create /var/www/html/filetrader/ext ~/.pearrc
$ pear install -o PEAR
$ pear install HTTP_Download

This will make PEAR available in the "ext" directory. If you have 
a complete PEAR installation (including HTTP_Download) on your 
system you can set the config flag 'pear_path' in config.php.
